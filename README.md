# TEST TASK

Exercise is as follows:

1. **Create the app landing page** (Sketch artboard; iPad-home).  The player must be able to initiate gameplay by tapping on Euro Millions — this will create an entertaining transition to the next screen (Sketch artboard; EuroMillion-game-play1).  You don’t have to make other games functional.
1. **Create a number selection experience that breaths life into this design** (Sketch artboard; EuroMillion-game-play1).  The player should be able to select and deselect their numbers.
1. **“Clear” and “Cancel”** must be functional. (“Lucky Dip” is optional).
1. **“Create Betslip” should transition back to the first screen** (Sketch artboard; iPad-home) and reset the experience.
1. **Submit to a Git repository**, providing a link for us to review.
